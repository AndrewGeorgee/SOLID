/// LISKOV SUBSTITUTION PRINCIPLE (LSP)
/// 
/// Definition:
/// Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses
/// without breaking the application. Derived classes must be substitutable for
/// their base classes without altering the correctness of the program.
/// 
/// Key Points:
/// - Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types
/// - Subclasses should not weaken the postconditions of the base class
/// - Subclasses should not strengthen the preconditions of the base class
/// - Subclasses should preserve all invariants of the base class
/// 
/// Benefits:
/// - Ensures proper inheritance hierarchy
/// - Prevents unexpected behavior when substituting classes
/// - Makes code more reliable and predictable
/// - Enables polymorphism to work correctly
