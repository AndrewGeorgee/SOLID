/// OPEN/CLOSED PRINCIPLE (OCP)
/// 
/// Definition:
/// Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for
/// extension but closed for modification. This means you should be able to add
/// new functionality without changing existing code.
/// 
/// Key Points:
/// - Open for extension: New behavior can be added
/// - Closed for modification: Existing code should not be changed
/// - Use abstraction (interfaces/abstract classes) to achieve this
/// - Prefer composition and polymorphism over modification
/// 
/// Benefits:
/// - Reduces risk of breaking existing functionality
/// - Makes code more maintainable
/// - Encourages use of interfaces and abstractions
/// - Easier to add new features
