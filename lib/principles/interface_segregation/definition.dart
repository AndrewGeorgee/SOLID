/// INTERFACE SEGREGATION PRINCIPLE (ISP)
/// 
/// Definition:
/// Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
/// Instead of one fat interface, many small, specific interfaces are preferred.
/// 
/// Key Points:
/// - No client should be forced to depend on methods it doesn't use
/// - Split large interfaces into smaller, more specific ones
/// - Classes should only implement interfaces they actually need
/// - Prefer composition of multiple interfaces over one large interface
/// 
/// Benefits:
/// - Reduces coupling between classes
/// - Makes interfaces more focused and easier to understand
/// - Prevents classes from implementing unnecessary methods
/// - Improves code maintainability and flexibility
