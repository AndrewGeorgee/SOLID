/// DEPENDENCY INVERSION PRINCIPLE (DIP)
/// 
/// Definition:
/// High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should
/// depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details.
/// Details should depend on abstractions.
/// 
/// Key Points:
/// - Depend on abstractions (interfaces/abstract classes), not concrete classes
/// - High-level modules define the business logic
/// - Low-level modules implement the details
/// - Both depend on abstractions, not each other
/// - Enables dependency injection and inversion of control
/// 
/// Benefits:
/// - Reduces coupling between modules
/// - Makes code more flexible and testable
/// - Enables easy swapping of implementations
/// - Facilitates dependency injection
/// - Improves maintainability
