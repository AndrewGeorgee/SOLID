/// SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY PRINCIPLE (SRP)
/// 
/// Definition:
/// A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only
/// one job or responsibility. Each class should be focused on doing one thing well.
/// 
/// Key Points:
/// - Each class should have a single, well-defined purpose
/// - Changes to one aspect of functionality should not affect unrelated features
/// - Makes code more maintainable, testable, and easier to understand
/// 
/// Benefits:
/// - Easier to maintain and modify
/// - Better testability
/// - Reduced coupling between classes
/// - Clearer code organization
